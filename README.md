# NN-based-on-linear-equation-accelerator

This project introduces a new neural network architecture along with a novel weight-update algorithm to solve nonlinear equations of any type. It also provides a hardware accelerator tailored to the proposed neural network architecture. Further details can be found in the paper [An Ultrafast Neural Network-Based Hardware Acceleration for Nonlinear Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045790618329070) Simulators.
The contributors to this project are the same as those listed in the paper.
